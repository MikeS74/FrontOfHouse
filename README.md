## Code Explaination
Both jQuery and typehead.js take in search terms and connect to the Zomato API simultaneously giving word suggestions and performing a restaurant search. 

A JavaScript 'for loop' grabs and pushes results into a 'div' to generate a list the user can click on. 

Once the user clicks a restaurant from the list, the API info is temporarily stored in a SQL table and used to generate a 'restaurant profile' with matched reviews from a separate 'reviews' table.

A JavaScript if statement then checks the current restaurant against the 'reviews' table with an AJAX GET request so jQuery can display user reviews for only that restaurant.

The user can then add a review for the current restaurant with an HTML form, jQuery and an AJAX POST to the 'reviews' SQL table.
